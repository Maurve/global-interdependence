            <p class="title">Communication and Globalization</p>
            <p class="text">
                Since globalization has started communication has improved a ton. In the past, phones didn't even exist, and when they did in the beginning, you couldn't really
                call someone from across the globe. Since cell phones and computers came out, people all over the world can interact with each other without having to fly
                to see them in person. Apps like Zoom, Skype, Discord, and FaceTime have contributed to this.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                It's not just simple communication that has improved since globalization, businesses have boomed because they can work with others across the globe to increase
                their profits. Having the ability to communicate to those outside of the corporate office is great for building your business up. Clients from other countries
                increase your total amount, and you won't have to just go with clients within your country/area because you don't have access to those outside of your country/area.
                Companies can also hire people from the other side of the world because of the rise in remote workers. A downside to this would be the fluency of the language
                you or the employee speaks. Making sure your new employee from another country can speak your country's main language fluently is important.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Job insecurity is an issue when it comes to this. Developed countries may outsource their jobs to less developed countries, leaving more people in developed
                countries out of work because of labor costs. You probably know about China making things that we use today. That's because their labor costs are low, and
                businesses can keep making more profits while the people in China are sweating and making less than $10 or maybe even $5 an hour.
                Safety standards are also ignored because workers in less developed countries can just be replaced by someone else without a break. The cycle goes on.
            </p>

                With these advances, in-person communication has decreased. While it is great to communicate with those through screens, you may still feel isolated when you don't
                interact with those around you. It's crucial to have a balance in-between in-person and online communication.
