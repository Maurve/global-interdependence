            <p class="title">The Environment and Globalization</p>
            <p class="text">
                The transportation of goods has increased due to globalization. Labor, materials, and components can be transported between countries.
                Because of this emissions have increased because vehicles create greenhouse gases which contributes to pollution, climinate change, and ocean acidification.
                Habitats are also being destroyed because of roads and bridges being built where animals may live. Shipping containers can contain bad species like
                fungus.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Overspecialization is an issue when it comes to globalization. There has been illegal deforestation in Brazil because of the increase in cattle operations
                which means more land is needed for grazing. Overfishing has been an issue in southeast Asia which is why the fish population has been decreasing there.
                Cash crops like coffee, cacao, and fruits, which contributed to the loss of habitats made countries overdependent on them.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                With an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, ocean acidification, and deforestation, biodiversity decreases with all of this present.
                Having these issues is never a good thing for globalization, but food ingredients can be transferred this way, and people may not want this to stop as it makes
                them money. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the population of all organisms have decreased 68 percent since 1970 due to these issues.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                While all of this seems bad, people have seen how bad this has become, and various laws and regulations have been put into place to slow down the killing of
                other organisms and deforestation. Businesses that operate around the globe most likely won't stop this, and this issue won't be put to rest for good.
                It will slowly become worse.
